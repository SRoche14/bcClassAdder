# bcClassAdder
adds classes to your google calendar from EagleApps

to get an executable, go to the executables branch and download the right zip for your operating system! It will unzip an executable file. When you run it, use your bc email. Your email/password information is used to authenticate you into agora and into google calendar. 

When done, please double check to make sure all your classes were uploaded correctly, and let me know if this does not work for you :)
